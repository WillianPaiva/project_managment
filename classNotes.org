* project management
the course will based on a project made by the university called "fete de la cience"
the CDC cam be found on the teachers web page
** scrum
   topic to ready about as the teacher will be using this as reference
** overview -> software and project management
*** software life cycle
    members of a project:
    1. owner
    2. user
    3. developer

**** the birth of the project
     1. the user has a need! (even if he doesn't know that)
     2. the owner express this need on a CDC
     3. the developer realize the CDC -> delivery
**** life
     4. the owner deploys the product
     5. the user "uses"
     6. the user find anomalies and also wants improvements
     7. the owner express this anomalies and those improvements on the CDC
     8. the developer realize those changes

**** death
     product has no more users
     owner pulls the plug
     the devs has no work

*** kinds of projects
**** project development
     starts: at the receiving of the CDC
     finish: at delivery
**** project "TMA"
     projects based on improvements for a software already deployed
**** project "MEP" "mise en production"
     projects responsible to take care of the deployment environment

** development project
   user-->owner-->CDC-->   DEV  -->delivery-->owner-->user


*** CDC
    *what is the devs responsibility over the CDC*

**** analyze
     specify what cam be done and what will be done and gives the costs to realize this.
**** conception
     the project structuring and organization "task division"
**** development
     hands on !!!

***** analyze
      in: CDC
      out: specification - what will be done and costs

      best practices enumerate the list of needs and cherry pick them
      process known as *backlog* on scrum
****** chifrage
       every calculation is done in man working day
       1 day is equivalent a --> 150 lines of code --> 1 class .....
       estimate cost of 1 day is 500euros

***** conception
      organization cut the project in Little modules
      most used:
      cascade
      spiral
      dev on "v"
      and agyle
